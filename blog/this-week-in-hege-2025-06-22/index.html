<p><strong><em>This week in $HEGE, for the week of June 16 – June 22, 2025.</em></strong></p>
<p>Hello Hegends! It’s time for another weekly update from your favorite team. This week again, markets have been on the edge of their seats trying to make sense of what’s happening in the Middle East. Lots of uncertainty. Lots of fear. On our end, we try to ignore all of that most of the time, because it’s way beyond our power to control. Instead, we put all our focus on building and delivering. And this week, delivered we have!</p>
<p>Let’s dive in.</p>

<h2 id="market-update">Market update</h2>
<p>We’ll start with a short market update.</p>
<p>Of course the big thing this week again has been the escalating attacks between Israel and Iran. And this morning we learned that the US has now entered the conflict as well. The added uncertainty and fear has caused the markets to sell off across the board, with the altcoin market being hit especially hard.</p>
<p>We’re not going to try to predict what will happen next or how long this will drag on for. The geopolitical machinations at play here are way beyond our humble hedgehog brains to comprehend. It could blow over fast, it could drag on. We’ll just have to sit tight and see.</p>
<p>While all eyes have been on the Middle East, a few positive things of note have happened during the week as well.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, June 17, with support from both parties, the US Senate passed their GENIUS Act. Passing this bill moves the US one step closer to a solid regulation of stablecoins, and it’s a big win for crypto. It now has to be passed by the House to go into law. There has been some pushback about the bill not offering enough protection against corruption. But Trump is pushing for it to get passed, and meanwhile Treasury secretary Scott Bessent has been out bullposting about stablecoins on X. It seems likely it will be passed within the coming months.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the US Fed decided to keep the interest rate unchanged. This was expected by the markets, and did not have much of an impact. Chairman Powell is warning that Trump’s tariffs will increase inflation in the coming months. This makes them want to avoid cutting rates too soon. Nonetheless, they still project two rate cuts this year, as before. ll in all, what the Fed does right now has little impact on the markets, compared to everything else that’s going on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, inflows to the bitcoin and ethereum ETFs continue to be strong. In addition, Strategy bagged another $1 billion worth of BTC, and it seems almost every day there is news about other companies announcing their own plans to either start buying crypto, or to buy more of it. Companies buying crypto is clearly becoming one of the key narratives this cycle. In our view, this is very bullish.</p>
<h2 id="hegend-nft-giveaway-results">Hegend NFT giveaway results</h2>
<p>The winner from @andcrypt0’s giveway has been chosen. Big congrats to “@speace_89” on X for winning the Hegend Magenta Warrior NFT!!</p>
<p>And huge thanks to Andcrypt0 for sponsoring the giveaway. If you haven’t already, go subscribe to his Youtube channel and watch and like his videos. He also has an X account, so make sure to subscribe to that too!</p>

<p>The larger the audience he gets, the better it is for him of course. But the better it also is for Hege. Win-win, just how we like it.</p>
<h2 id="the-hege-merch-store-is-now-live">The Hege Merch Store is now live!</h2>
<p>On to the big news this week: the new Hege Merch Store is FINALLY LAUNCHED!</p>
<p>This has been months in the making, with our team member Ash being the big brain behind it all. He’s really been grinding his ass off for this one, so much love and big respect to his dedication and hard work. A true Hegend!</p>
<p>Go check it out at <a href="https://shop.hegecoin.com/">https://shop.hegecoin.com/</a></p>
<p>You get free international shipping on all items. And to celebrate, use the code LAUNCH15 for 15% off on checkout (valid until Wednesday, June 25th).</p>
<p>Because all of this is built completely in-house by our amazing team, we can take 100% of the profits and push them straight back into the project. This will help pay for future marketing campaigns, exchange listings, and other developments.</p>
<p>Not gonna lie, we’re really proud of this one. The merch is dope, and we can’t wait to see it out in the wild. This marks a big step on our journey to evolving into a fully fledged brand. And the launch is only the start — we’ve got plenty of more exclusive drops coming!</p>
<figure class="image"><a href="/r/2025096856.webp"><img src="/r/2025096856.webp" width="1920" height="1920" alt="" loading="lazy"></a>

<h2 id="up-ahead-in-the-coming-week">Up ahead in the coming week</h2>
<p>All focus the coming week will be on the Hege Merch Store of course. You can all help out by spreading the word in any way you can think of!</p>
<p>With all going on with the merch, we didn’t get to announce the winners in the Disasterpiece contest. Sorry about that! We haven’t forgotten about it and we’ll do our best to get it done this week. We might also have another small surprise launch in store. Stay tuned!</p>
<h2 id="thanks-for-reading">Thanks for reading!</h2>
<p>That marks the end of this week’s update. Thanks for reading and thanks for being a part of the community and helping to write the Hege story. We hope the turmoil in the markets and in the world will calm down in the weeks to come. But regardless of what will happen next, we will keep building. That’s for sure!</p>
