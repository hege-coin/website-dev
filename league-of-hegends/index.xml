      <description>What can we say about 3nino? The Italian stallion.&#xA;He&amp;rsquo;s a working man by night and a Hegend at day, driven by a mission to slap stickers throughout the home of the Romans. He&amp;rsquo;s been here as long as hedgehogs have existed (well, we think) and no matter what the market looks like, keeps his spikes out.&#xA;Dependable, bullish, and hard-working, he does as the Romans did — dominates.&#xA;</description>

      <description> Yo yo has been with Hege since the earliest days, a true OG in the League of Hegends. On his own initiative, and never for profit, he’s sent over 277 sticker packages around the world, spreading Hege like a sleeper that never stops spinning.&#xA;Details about him are scarce, but his username hints at power beyond measure, maybe even enough to split the atom. What we do know is that yo yo keeps the community looping together: walking the dog, rocking the baby, eiffel towering his generosity, Around the corner with every new drop, and brain twister-level dedication that no one saw coming. </description>

      <description>A myth. A man. A Hegend. PlantFaceAsh (AKA MMAlegend6969 AKA do NOT f*ck with me) has helped truly make Hegecoin what it is today—a brand. From working with artists to establish Hegecoin on DRiP, to nearly singlehandedly crafting the merchandise store, to laying the smackdown to FUD-ers and scammers in chat (and recently, even exposing a scammer outside of the community), PlantFaceAsh has solidified himself as one of the most Hegendary Hegends in the space. We are eternally grateful for his help, his persistence, his creativity, and most importantly, his extensive use of 69.&#xA;</description>

      <description>Hege was born on Reddit, so our presence there has always been important. And nobody embodies this like Flo. Every day, he posts to the HegeCoin sub. Every new post, he’s there commenting. Every project announcement, he’s got it up on Reddit within five minutes. He’s a legit Reddit machine. And not only that, you can always find him in Hegequarters, spreading positivity and rallying the troops. He’s a true delusional believer, and we wouldn’t want him any other way.&#xA;</description>

      <description>Memecoins live and die by their communities, and Ryan truly is the perfect community member. Never afraid to speak his mind and share his ideas, his ongoing positivity is a source of inspiration and motivation for all his fellow Hegends. He’s the kind of guy you always want on your side, and no doubt Hege is a better place with him around. Whatever you do Ryan, never stop being you!&#xA;</description>

      <description>Raiding is a cornerstone of every successful memecoin, and Vector (Big Dawg) is a master of the art. His quality and commitment makes him a role model for every aspiring raider to follow. Even when there are no competitions running, he keeps going, from daily posts on CryptoTwits, to banger tweets on X. He&amp;rsquo;s a true Hegend, and we’re blessed to have him around.&#xA;</description>
