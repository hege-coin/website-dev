      <description>&lt;p&gt;What can we say about 3nino? The Italian stallion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s a working man by night and a Hegend at day, driven by a mission to slap&#xA;stickers throughout the home of the Romans. He&amp;rsquo;s been here as long as hedgehogs&#xA;have existed (well, we think) and no matter what the market looks like, keeps&#xA;his spikes out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dependable, bullish, and hard-working, he does as the Romans did — dominates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xA;Yo yo has been with Hege since the earliest days, a true OG in the League of Hegends. On his own initiative, and never for profit, he’s sent over 277 sticker packages &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKNKztrlR9U&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;around the world&lt;/a&gt;, spreading Hege like a &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/H7AzdGhhqtc?si=IX0VLiMPd4YDLyzl&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;sleeper&lt;/a&gt; that never stops spinning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;Details about him are scarce, but his username hints at power beyond measure, maybe even enough to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k25KK79-E4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;split the atom&lt;/a&gt;. What we do know is that yo yo keeps the community looping together: &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/aCxQkb_xMFw?si=x7yD1cfEwJcFM6i1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;walking the dog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/oYiUkbBC6dY?si=tI_M30mfdRzyyQz0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;rocking the baby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/NMGvkQvqeFs?si=4a4V6TRFEshxWQ58&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;eiffel towering&lt;/a&gt; his generosity, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvdIQOd67xg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Around the corner&lt;/a&gt; with every new drop, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-V9KngiL2Y&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;brain twister&lt;/a&gt;-level dedication that no one saw coming.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A myth. A man. A Hegend. PlantFaceAsh (AKA MMAlegend6969 AKA do NOT f*ck with&#xA;me) has helped truly make Hegecoin what it is today—a brand. From working with&#xA;artists to establish Hegecoin on DRiP, to nearly singlehandedly crafting the&#xA;merchandise store, to laying the smackdown to FUD-ers and scammers in chat (and&#xA;recently, even exposing a scammer outside of the community), PlantFaceAsh has&#xA;solidified himself as one of the most Hegendary Hegends in the space. We are&#xA;eternally grateful for his help, his persistence, his creativity, and most&#xA;importantly, his extensive use of 69.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hege was born on Reddit, so our presence there has always been important. And&#xA;nobody embodies this like Flo. Every day, he posts to the HegeCoin sub. Every&#xA;new post, he’s there commenting. Every project announcement, he’s got it up on&#xA;Reddit within five minutes. He’s a legit Reddit machine. And not only that, you&#xA;can always find him in Hegequarters, spreading positivity and rallying the&#xA;troops. He’s a true delusional believer, and we wouldn’t want him any other way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Memecoins live and die by their communities, and Ryan truly is the perfect&#xA;community member. Never afraid to speak his mind and share his ideas, his&#xA;ongoing positivity is a source of inspiration and motivation for all his fellow&#xA;Hegends. He’s the kind of guy you always want on your side, and no doubt Hege is&#xA;a better place with him around. Whatever you do Ryan, never stop being you!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Raiding is a cornerstone of every successful memecoin, and Vector (Big Dawg) is&#xA;a master of the art. His quality and commitment makes him a role model for every&#xA;aspiring raider to follow. Even when there are no competitions running, he keeps&#xA;going, from daily posts on CryptoTwits, to banger tweets on X. He&amp;rsquo;s a true&#xA;Hegend, and we’re blessed to have him around.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
